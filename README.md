# MirrorTakeHome

A few things:
1. I took this opportunity to learn Swift, but don't know the ins and outs of the language, so there may be some bad practices. I tried my best to update the worse style as I learned, but there may be some inconsistencies between the code I started with and what I ended with.
2. There are no unit tests unfortunately :( I don't know how to write unit tests. Happy to learn! But it would've taken me too long to learn and implement well I think. I did try to design everything to be easily testable however.
3. I created some views in Storyboard that I ended up not using. Everything should be programmatic.
